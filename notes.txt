What is hashing?

Hashing means turning a piece of data (like a password) into a long, scrambled string using a math formula (hash function).
Example:
"mypassword" → "5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99"
It’s one-way — you can’t turn it back into the original password.
How it works for storing passwords:
User signs up → enters a password.
Server hashes the password (e.g., using bcrypt).
Server saves only the hash in the database — not the real password.
When user logs in later:
Server hashes the entered password again
Compares it to the stored hash
If they match → login success 
Hashing is one-way.
You can turn a password → hash,
but you cannot turn a hash → password again.
That’s what makes hashing so useful for security — even if someone gets the hash from the database, they can’t reverse it to see the original password.


In login API we create a token but not verify the token.


Creating custom middleware:
As we need to keep some routes to be protected meaning if user is not logged in then they cannot be able to access that particular route/API so instead of writing the protected API code which is to check the token is present or not if yes the token is correct or no again and again we create a custom middleware where we write that code to  check and verify the the token only one time. to create a middleware we create a folder in src name middleware and in that we create a file called auth.middleware.js we write the logic there and export that function and use it wherever we want using require.

eg:
router.post('/',authMiddleware, createPostController)
so first request will go to the api then to the middleware there if everything is correct then will create user property in req so in req.user will set userdata in req.user then next() in authMiddleware will call and the main req will go to the createPostController
