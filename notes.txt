What is hashing?

Hashing means turning a piece of data (like a password) into a long, scrambled string using a math formula (hash function).
Example:
"mypassword" → "5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99"
It’s one-way — you can’t turn it back into the original password.
How it works for storing passwords:
User signs up → enters a password.
Server hashes the password (e.g., using bcrypt).
Server saves only the hash in the database — not the real password.
When user logs in later:
Server hashes the entered password again
Compares it to the stored hash
If they match → login success 
Hashing is one-way.
You can turn a password → hash,
but you cannot turn a hash → password again.
That’s what makes hashing so useful for security — even if someone gets the hash from the database, they can’t reverse it to see the original password.


In login API we create a token but not verify the token.
